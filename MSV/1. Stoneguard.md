## Strategy Overview (Heroic Stack + Energized Tiles)

This fight uses the “stack” strategy: all active Guardians are stacked together to maximize cleave damage and efficiently manage mechanics. In Heroic mode, Guardians and mechanics hit much harder, so precision, cooldown usage, and movement are key. Heroic also introduces **Living Crystals** next to each Guardian—clicking them empowers tiles on the floor, giving the raid a stacking **Damage & Spirit buff** (reset at 75% and 40% boss health). Assign mobile ranged players to “paint” tiles to boost your DPS significantly.

Core mechanics:

* **Stacking Guardians** causes them to gain energy and thus periodically Overload, dealing mass raid-wide damage.
* You must ensure that whichever Guardian is applying **Petrification** (i.e., reducing damage taken from a particular element) is the one that **Overloads** at the right time—this clears stacks safely.

* Avoid environmental hazards unless under a matching Petrification debuff.
* Use defensive cooldowns to survive the Overload damage (often 500k+, combined into \~1.5M if all Guardians Overload at once).

## Role-by-Role Instructions

### Tanks: Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

You two will **tank all three active Guardians stacked together**. Your job:

* Keep them tightly grouped and rotated between the two of you based on which Guardian has the Petrification debuff and energy levels—ensuring the petrifying one is allowed to Overload. ([Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MMOJUGG](https://www.mmojugg.com/news/stone-guard-boss-guide-for-wow-mop-classic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Use cooldowns smartly (e.g., Dearg Grip for DK, Barkskin/ironfur for Druid) to survive the incoming Overload and heavy damage while healing stabilizes the raid. ([Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Avoid standing in hazardous zones like Amethyst Pools or Cobalt Mines (your healers may need to push through temporarily for cleansing).

### Healers: Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) & Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Prioritize **tanking cooldowns** when Overload happens—Cohesion between heals and tank cooldowns is critical.
* Provide raid-wide healing to survive disastrous Overload hits.
* **Keep one of you mobile to paint tiles**—Mistweaver Monk’s mobility or Disc’s Divine Star can help. Assign one of you to click crystals at \~pull start and after 75%/40% phases, then run tiles to spread Energized buff. ([Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MMOJUGG](https://www.mmojugg.com/news/stone-guard-boss-guide-for-wow-mop-classic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### Rogue: StabyStabby (Assassination)

* Assist with **painting tiles** if needed—rogues are agile.
* Can use defensive cooldowns (e.g., Cloak of Shadows) to help handle environmental effects like Cobalt Mines if necessary.
* Maintain cleave pressure, helping with Burst DPS when the Energized tile buff is up.

### Warrior: Danifaye (Arms)

* Excellent cleave potential—split your output across all Guardians.
* Help **paint tiles**, if not already covered by ranged, since Arms has good mobility.
* Save cooldowns (e.g., Enrage, Die by the Sword) for Overload phases or dangerous mechanics.

### Hunters: Shootinguatm (Beast Mastery), Zurk & Blonker (Survival)

**Hunters are prime tile painters due to mobility—assign at least two and coordinate their usage:**

* On pull, click the Living Crystal, run tiles for Energized stacks, return quick.
* Repeat at 75% and 40% boss health phases.
* While painting, be mindful of Amethyst Pools / Cobalt Mines: only cross these hazards when under matching Petrification or with cooldowns like Deterrence. ([Warcraft Tavern](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/mop/guides/the-stone-guard/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MMOJUGG](https://www.mmojugg.com/news/stone-guard-boss-guide-for-wow-mop-classic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Stay in range to contribute DPS when not painting.

### Warlock: Scumlyfe (Affliction)

* Great for sustained cleave via DoTs—apply multi-target DoTs across Guardians.
* You can also assist a tile route if needed (warp/portals not helpful here, so mostly cleave focus).
* Use personal defensive cooldowns if overwhelmed by AoE damage during Overload. ([Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Heroic Mode Specific Tips

1. **Tiles are critical**—boosting DPS and Spirit lets your healers recover faster after Overloads. Assign at least 2 hunters and a healer to paint. ([Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MMOJUGG](https://www.mmojugg.com/news/stone-guard-boss-guide-for-wow-mop-classic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
2. **Cooldown planning**—coordinate raid-wide cooldowns (Healing Tide, Barrier, etc.) so one set is fresh for each Overload. Heroic damage is punishing. ([Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Warcraft Tavern](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/mop/guides/the-stone-guard/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
3. **Awareness of mechanics**—avoid Amethyst Pools unless Amethyst Petrification is active; clear Cobalt Mines with cooldowns or wait; manage Jade Shards via healing; handle Jasper Chains by proximity or Sebastian Petrification.
